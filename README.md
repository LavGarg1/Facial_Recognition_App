# Checkpoint 1 (11th April 2021)
Task 1(A1):

Pandas exercise

task 2(A2):

Matplot exercise


Overall in checkpoint 1 we saw uses of different library functions to fetch imformation about Data

# Checkpoint 2 (8th June 2021)
Task 4(B3):

Live Age and Gender Detection: Here we learn about neural networks using some pre built trained models and we learn about basic machine learning.

Task 5(B4):

Age and gender detection on yt videoes: Here we took a step forward via upgrading our live age and gender dectection(Task 4(B3)) by applying it directly on any yt videoes.


Overall in checkpoint 2 basics of machine learning and neural network were established.

# Checkpoint 3 (18th July 2021)
Task 6(C1):

Making Android App for Gender+Age Dectection: Here we learn basics of android devlopment and learn that we need not to start making whole app from start,
rather we can use any other similar app and make changes in that in order to rech the required outcome.

Task 7(C2):

Making colab based Face Dectection+Recognition+Cluster Project: Here we aim to develop a simple face recognition app capable of detecting all faces in the image,
cropping the faces and extracting their features, and comparing the faces for clustering similar faces.
